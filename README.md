# Los-Angeles-Violent-Blade-Crimes-2010-2023
A data analysis of Los Angeles crime data focusing on violent crimes committed with blades

Feel free to download the slide deck (.pdf format) for an overview.
The topic is very narrowly focused and presented to a specific audience.

First, download the Los Angeles crime data sets for 2010-2019 and 2020-2024:

Secondly, run the second code chunk that will download historical Los Angeles weather
from the Open-Meteo API. Or you can use the attached .csv file.

The first code chunk is exploratory and is not necessary to run the data analysis and visuals in 
chunks three and four.
